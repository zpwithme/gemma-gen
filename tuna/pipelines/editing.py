    Edit images according to text instructions.

    Dispatches to the underlying ``pipeline.t2i_edit`` method, which is
    implemented by all three Tuna pipeline variants.

    Args:
        pipeline: A Tuna pipeline instance with a ``t2i_edit`` method.
        images: Source-image tensor of shape (B, N, C, H, W) where N is the
            number of conditioning images per example (typically 1). The model
            uses these as the "before" image for the edit.
        instructions: A single edit instruction or a list of instructions, one
            per example in the batch.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments forwarded to ``pipeline.t2i_edit`` —
            common ones include ``num_inference_steps``, ``guidance_scale``,
            ``sampling_method``, ``time_shifting_factor``.

    Returns:
        A list of edited PIL images.
